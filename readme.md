Just download the index.html file and run it from your file manager. If you would like to add more games yourself, fork the repository, go into index.html and modify the link for the external script source, and then go to script.js and add all the games you would ever want. If you would like to add roms from other consoles, you have to change the script source from index.html, then in script.js add the game title to the cooresponding variable. For example, if you have a game in HMR3_optionText called Super Mario 64 and its an n64 game, you have to add Super Mario 64 to the HMR3_N64 variable.

Submit an issue if there are any features you would like to be added.

By the way, I did not code the pokedex. If you want the source code to the pokedex, here's the link: https://github.com/davidhckh/pokedex
